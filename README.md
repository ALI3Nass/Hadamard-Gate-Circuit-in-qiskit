# hadamard-Gate-Circuit-in-Qiskit

This repository contains examples of quantum computing using Qiskit, a Python framework for working with quantum circuits and simulating quantum systems. The code snippets provided demonstrate various quantum operations and simulations.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using the following command:

pip install qiskit


## Usage

The code snippets provided can be run in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment. Each code block showcases a specific quantum operation or simulation. You can copy and paste the code blocks into your environment to experiment with quantum computing using Qiskit.

Here's a breakdown of the code snippets:

- **Check Qiskit version**: Verify the installed version of Qiskit.
- **Authentication with IBM Quantum**: Save and load your IBM Quantum API key for accessing IBM Quantum systems.
- **Hello Qiskit**: A simple code snippet to test the Qiskit installation.
- **Creating a Quantum Circuit**: Demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit using Qiskit and visualize it.
- **Applying Quantum Gates**: Shows how to apply quantum gates to the qubits in the circuit.
- **Measuring Qubits**: Measures the qubits in the circuit and displays the measurement results.
- **Simulating with QASM Simulator**: Simulates the quantum circuit using the QASM simulator backend and visualizes the measurement results.
- **Running on IBM Quantum Systems**: Executes the circuit on an IBM Quantum system and monitors the job status.
- **Getting Results**: Retrieves and analyzes the results from the executed job.

Feel free to explore and modify the code snippets to experiment with quantum computing concepts using Qiskit.
